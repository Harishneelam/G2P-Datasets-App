Title <- "Genomic signals of local adaptation across climatically heterogenous habitats in an invasive tropical fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni)"
Abstract <- "Local adaptation plays a key role in the successful establishment of pest populations in new environments by enabling them to tolerate novel biotic and abiotic conditions experienced outside their native range. However, the genomic underpinnings of such adaptive responses remain unclear, especially for agriculturally important pests. We investigated population genomic signatures in the tropical/subtropical Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, which has an expanded range encompassing temperate and arid zones in Australia, and tropical zones in the Pacific Islands. Using reduced representation sequencing data from 28 populations, we detected allele frequency shifts associated with the native/invasive status of populations and identified environmental factors that have likely driven population differentiation. We also determined that precipitation, temperature, and geographic variables explain allelic shifts across the distribution range of B. tryoni. We found spatial heterogeneity in signatures of local adaptation across various climatic conditions in invaded areas. Specifically, disjunct invasive populations in the tropical Pacific Islands and arid zones of Australia were characterised by multiple significantly differentiated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), some of which were associated with genes with well-understood function in environmental stress (e.g., heat and desiccation) response. However, invasive populations in southeast Australian temperate zones showed higher gene flow with the native range and lacked a strong local adaptive signal. These results suggest that population connectivity with the native range has differentially affected local adaptive patterns in different invasive populations. Overall, our findings provide insights into the evolutionary underpinnings of invasion success of an important horticultural pest in climatically distinct environments."

Title <- "Strong genetic structure in a widespread estuarine crab: A test of potential versus realized dispersal"
Abstract <- "Aim: Genetic structure has proven difficult to predict for marine and estuarine species with multi-day pelagic larval durations, since many disperse far less than expected based on passive transport models. In such cases, the gap between potential and realized dispersal may result from larval behaviors that evolved to facilitate retention and settlement in favorable environments. Behavior is predicted to play a particularly key role in structuring truly estuarine species, which often moderate their behavior to remain within their natal estuaries. In such systems, this restricted dispersal may lead to high divergence, local adaptation, and eventual speciation across their range. Here, we test whether a geographically widespread estuarine crab, known to have behavior promoting larval retention, exhibits high population structure despite a 2-4 week larval duration.
Location: Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America Taxon: White-fingered mud crab, Rhithropanopeus harrisii
Methods: Population genomic analyses across nine estuaries from New Hampshire to Louisiana using 12,638 transcriptome-derived SNPs.
Results: We found highly differentiated genetic signatures among all nine estuaries, separated by 200-5,000 km of coastline. Estimates of gene flow suggest that migration is low and largely symmetrical between sites. We also observed deep phylogenetic divides corresponding to major biogeographic breaks.
Main conclusions: These results indicate substantial and longstanding constraints to dispersal in the species’ native range, likely arising from the emergence of geological and oceanographic barriers and sustained by behavior that promotes estuarine retention during larval development. This work supports the idea that larval behavior promoting estuarine retention can be reflected in substantial genetic structure even in species with multi-week pelagic larval durations. Such behavior-restricted dispersal has implications for predicting adaptation and spread in estuarine species, many of which have been introduced outside their native ranges."

Title <- "Genetic relationships and inbreeding levels among geographically distant populations of Felis catus from Japan and the United States"
Abstract <- "Pedigreed cats have traditionally been mated with close relatives, which increases the risks for inbreeding depression and genetic disorders. We evaluated the genome-wide population structure and the degree of inbreeding of 1022 cats, including 13 pedigreed and two random bred populations from Japan and the USA, using single nucleotide polymorphism array-based data. Ancestry structure analysis revealed Japan's American Curl, Norwegian Forest, and Siamese cat populations were genetically distinct from their American counterparts. Furthermore, we found an ancestral genetic component shared between five pedigreed and random bred Japanese cats, suggesting the breeds were admixed with Japanese cats or cats of east Asian origin. Between-country differences in inbreeding estimates based on runs of homozygosity were found for Maine Coon, Siamese, and random bred cats. To reduce the risks of inbreeding depression and genetic disorders, particularly for highly inbred breeds, such as Abyssinian cats, as well as Russian Blue and Siamese cats in the USA, appropriate breeding practices must be observed, including mating practices that increase the genetic diversity."

Title <- "Genetic loci associated with winter survivorship in diverse lowland switchgrass populations"
Abstract <- "High winter mortality limits biomass yield of lowland switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) planted in the northern latitudes of North America. Breeding of cold tolerant switchgrass cultivars requires many years due to its perennial growth habit and the unpredictable winter selection pressure that is required to identify winter-hardy individuals. Identification of causal genetic variants for winter survivorship would accelerate the improvement of switchgrass biomass production. The objective of this study was to identify allelic variation associated with winter survivorship in lowland switchgrass populations using bulk segregant analysis (BSA). Twenty-nine lowland switchgrass populations were evaluated for winter survival at two locations in southern Wisconsin and 21 populations with differential winter survivorship were used for BSA. A maximum of 10% of the individuals (8–20) were bulked to create survivor and nonsurvivor DNA pools from each population and location. The DNA pools were evaluated using exome capture sequencing, and allele frequencies were used to conduct statistical tests. The BSA tests revealed nine quatitative trait loci (QTL) from tetraploid populations and seven QTL from octoploid populations. Many QTL were population-specific, but some were identified in multiple populations that originated across a broad geographic landscape. Four QTL (at positions 88 Mb on chromosome 2N, 115 Mb on chromosome 5K, and 1 and 100 Mb on chromosome 9N) were potentially the most useful QTL. Markers associated with winter survivorship in this study can be used to accelerate breeding cycles of lowland switchgrass populations and should lead to improvements in adaptation within USDA hardiness zones 4 and 5."

Title <- "Estimating genomic diversity and population differentiation – an empirical comparison of microsatellite and SNP variation in Arabidopsis halleri"
Abstract <- "Background
Microsatellite markers are widely used for estimating genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations. However, it has rarely been tested whether such estimates are useful proxies for genome-wide patterns of variation and differentiation. Here, we compared microsatellite variation with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assess and quantify potential marker-specific biases and derive recommendations for future studies. Overall, we genotyped 180 Arabidopsis halleri individuals from nine populations using 20 microsatellite markers. Twelve of these markers were originally developed for Arabidopsis thaliana (cross-species markers) and eight for A. halleri (species-specific markers). We further characterized 2 million SNPs across the genome with a pooled whole-genome re-sequencing approach (Pool-Seq).
Results
Our analyses revealed that estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation derived from cross-species and species-specific microsatellites differed substantially and that expected microsatellite heterozygosity (SSR-H e) was not significantly correlated with genome-wide SNP diversity estimates (SNP-H e and θ Watterson) in A. halleri. Instead, microsatellite allelic richness (A r) was a better proxy for genome-wide SNP diversity. Estimates of genetic differentiation among populations (F ST) based on both marker types were correlated, but microsatellite-based estimates were significantly larger than those from SNPs. Possible causes include the limited number of microsatellite markers used, marker ascertainment bias, as well as the high variance in microsatellite-derived estimates. In contrast, genome-wide SNP data provided unbiased estimates of genetic diversity independent of whether genome- or only exome-wide SNPs were used. Further, we inferred that a few thousand random SNPs are sufficient to reliably estimate genome-wide diversity and to distinguish among populations differing in genetic variation.
Conclusions
We recommend that future analyses of genetic diversity within and differentiation among populations use randomly selected high-throughput sequencing-based SNP data to draw conclusions on genome-wide diversity patterns. In species comparable to A. halleri, a few thousand SNPs are sufficient to achieve this goal."

Title <- "An SNP-based second-generation genetic map of Daphnia magna and its application to QTL analysis of phenotypic traits"
Abstract <- "Background
Although Daphnia is increasingly recognized as a model for ecological genomics and biomedical research, there is, as of yet, no high-resolution genetic map for the genus. Such a map would provide an important tool for mapping phenotypes and assembling the genome. Here we estimate the genome size of Daphnia magna and describe the construction of an SNP array based linkage map. We then test the suitability of the map for life history and behavioural trait mapping. The two parent genotypes used to produce the map derived from D. magna populations with and without fish predation, respectively and are therefore expected to show divergent behaviour and life-histories.
Results
Using flow cytometry we estimated the genome size of D. magna to be about 238 mb. We developed an SNP array tailored to type SNPs in a D. magna F2 panel and used it to construct a D. magna linkage map, which included 1,324 informative markers. The map produced ten linkage groups ranging from 108.9 to 203.6 cM, with an average distance between markers of 1.13 cM and a total map length of 1,483.6 cM (Kosambi corrected). The physical length per cM is estimated to be 160 kb. Mapping infertility genes, life history traits and behavioural traits on this map revealed several significant QTL peaks and showed a complex pattern of underlying genetics, with different traits showing strongly different genetic architectures.
Conclusions
The new linkage map of D. magna constructed here allowed us to characterize genetic differences among parent genotypes from populations with ecological differences. The QTL effect plots are partially consistent with our expectation of local adaptation under contrasting predation regimes. Furthermore, the new genetic map will be an important tool for the Daphnia research community and will contribute to the physical map of the D. magna genome project and the further mapping of phenotypic traits. The clones used to produce the linkage map are maintained in a stock collection and can be used for mapping QTLs of traits that show variance among the F2 clones."
